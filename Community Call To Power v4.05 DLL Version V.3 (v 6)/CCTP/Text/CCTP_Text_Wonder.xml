		<Text>The Aztecs built what was to become the capital of their empire on a small island in the Lake of Texcoco, in the Valley of Mexico. Testimonies from the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquerors at Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, account for the existence of the great lake dotted with a multitude of canoes and the island city, full of oratories like towers and fortresses and all gleaming white. The conquering Spaniards destroyed the island city of Tenochtitlan and started to drain the lake that surrounded it. They built the capital of New Spain, Mexico City, the “city of palaces”, on the ruins of the prehispanic city, following a European model which was slightly changed by the intervention of indigenous artisans and workers, and influenced by the canals and rivers that had structured the Pre-Hispanic city. Independent Mexico maintained its capital on the same place and added its stylistic influences to the architectonic palimpsest that we are left with today.</Text>

Dedicated to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar, the gate was constructed of blue glazed tiles with alternating rows of bas-relief sirrush (dragons) and aurochs. The roof and doors of the gate were of cedar, according to the dedication plaque.[NEWLINE]Through the gate ran the Processional Way, which was lined with walls covered in lions on glazed bricks (about 120 of them). Statues of the deities were paraded through the gate and down the Processional Way each year during the New Year's celebration.[NEWLINE]Originally the gate, being part of the Walls of Babylon, was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the world until, in the 6th century AD, it was replaced by the Lighthouse of Alexandria.</Text>

			<Text>Mesa Verde (Spanish for 'Green table') is the name given to a large area of what is now part of the American state of Colorado but was once a large settlement of the Pueblo (Anasazi) civilization of Native Americans. The area is believed to have been first settled c.400 CE, reaching its peak around the 12th-13th centuries before declining in the 1200's as a result of climate change and an increased population. One of the most iconic sites of Mesa Verde is the cliff palace, a large arrangement of buildings constructed under a rocky outcrop at the site which is believed to have been brightly painted during the peak of the Pueblo culture. Other than the cliff palace there are several more major Pueblo constructions within the area, including defensive towers and reservoirs, indicating that this site was once a thriving settlement.  </Text>

			<Text>Kronborg is a large star fortress located on the North-eastern tip of the Danish island of Zealand, near the town of Helsingør. It was constructed under the reign of Eric of Pomerania during the 1420s. Along with KArnan, another Danish fortress situated across the 4km wide Øresund, it was built predominantly to control the entrance to the Baltic Sea. This allowed for the Danish King to demand Øresundstolden, or Sound Dues. This was where all ships entering the Baltic had to pay a tax to the Danish king. If they refused, the cannons on either side of the sound would open fire on the ship and sink it. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1585 the castle was rebuilt under Frederick II of Denmark. This is when the castle became the large Rennaisance castle which it is now. In 1639 the castle was rebuilt by King Christian IV, after a fire ten years earlier. Less than 20 years later the castle was conquered by a Swedish army under Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Following this, the castle was heavily fortified moreso than before.</Text>

Together with other similar structures, these have been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Megalithic Temples of Malta.[NEWLINE]The temples were possibly the site of a Fertility cult; archeologists believe that the numerous figurines and statues found on site are connected with that cult. According to local Gozitan folklore, a giantess built these temples and used them as places of worship.</Text>

The structure would be 2000 meters (6,561 feet) above mean sea level, including 5 stacked trusses, each with similar dimensions to that of the great pyramid of Giza. This pyramid would help answer Tokyo's increasing lack of space, although the project would only handle 1/47th of the Greater Tokyo Area's population.

However, in exchange for local police and fire protection and other services, the U.N. agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The United Nations Headquarters complex was constructed in stages with the core complex completed between 1948-1952. The Headquarters occupies a site beside the East River, on 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land purchased from the foremost New York real estate developer of the time, William Zeckendorf, Sr. Nelson Rockefeller arranged this purchase, after an initial offer to locate it on the Rockefeller family estate of Kykuit was rejected as being too isolated from Manhattan. The US$8.5 million purchase was then funded by his father, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who donated it to the city. Wallace Harrison, the personal architectural adviser for the Rockefeller family, and a prominent corporate architect, served as the Director of Planning for the United Nations Headquarters.

It is part of a 50 km long aqueduct that runs between Uzès and Nîmes in the South of France. It is located in Vers-Pont-du-Gard near Remoulins, in the Gard département. The aqueduct was constructed by the Romans in the 1st century AD and it is the highest of all Roman aqueduct bridges.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The bridge has three rows of arches, standing 48.8 m high, and formerly carried an estimated 200 million litres of water a day to the fountains, baths and homes of the citizens of Nîmes. The aqueduct descends in height by only 17 m over its entire length, indicative of the great precision that Roman engineers were able to achieve using only simple technology. It was possibly used until as late as the 9th century, well after the fall of Rome. However, lack of maintenance after the 4th century meant that it became increasingly clogged by mineral deposits and debris that eventually choked off the flow of water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Pont du Gard's subsidiary function as a toll bridge ensured its survival in the Middle Ages. Although some of its stones were looted, the local lords and bishops were for centuries responsible for its upkeep in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river. It attracted increasing fame from the 18th century onwards and today it is one of France's most popular tourist attractions.</Text>

			<Text>Horyu-ji is a Buddhist temple located in the Nara Prefecture of Japan. The name translates as Temple of the Flourishing Law, with Ji translating as Temple. The complex was completed in the year 607, at which time it was known as Ikaruga-dera. The temple was comissioned by Prince Shotoku, the palace complex of whom occupied the eastern portion of the grounds. It is widely believed that the current temple is a restoration, after the original temple was destroyed in 670 by what is believed to be fire. Horyu-ji possesses a unique style of architecture, combining elements of Han and Wei Chinese Kingdoms, the Three Kingdoms of Korea and traditional Japanese architecture. The original temple would have lacked this, and as such the restoration allowed for a unique combination of architecture styles seen through exploration of the Eastern Asia region that is extremely unusal, and only seen in other Asuka style buildings in the Nara Prefecture, yet Horyu-ji is unique even amongst these. Other Asuka style complexes feature layouts that are similar to Chinese and Korean counterparts as well as the architecture. Horyu-ji, however, as it is a restoration, is built on the footprints of the earlier temple, and as such shares the layout, which is a Japanese temple style.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Horyu-ji has several different iconic buildings, each with features unique to the temple. The Pagoda is one of the oldest wooden buildings on Earth. The central pillar is constructed from a tree dated to being felled in 594 CE. At the base of this pillar is said to be a fragment of a bone of Buddha. The five tiered style of the pagoda means that one is not allowed to climb up. Horyu-ji also features a Kondō, the wood of which dates to 670 CE. This has been suggested as being proof that the building was under construction at the time of the fire that destroyed so much of the rest of the complex. The complex also houses several pieces that are national Japanese treasures, including Buddhist treasures dating to the 7th Century, murals which combine artstyles of Japan and mainland Asia, and are similar to those found in the Ajanta Caves of India. There are also Kannon statuettes and other religious iconography. </Text>

It was completed in 691 CE on the site of the Second Jewish Temple, and restored several times since. It is centered around the 'foundation rock', a rock upon which it is believed that the prophet Muhammed ascended to heaven. Interestingly, the Dome of the Rock was constructed not as a mosque, but rather as a shrine for Muslim pilgrims venturing to the Holy Land. Below the Dome of the Rock are a series of caverns which run throughout Jerusalem. These can be accessed via a crack in the Foundation Rock which leads to a cave known as the 'Well of Souls', a term made popular by the movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. The exterior of the dome is made from porcelain and is octagonal in shape. Predominantly blue in the upper sections, islamic motifs cover the entire section.

The Tenpyo era followed and caused severe devastation and epidemics. These prompted Shomu to promote the construction of provincial temples across Japan. Known then as Kinshosen-ji, Shomu appointed Todai-ji the Provincial temple of Yamato Province and the head of all the temples. The complex maintained influence in the province and the rest of Japan until Japanese Buddhism moved from Nara to Mount Hiei and the capital of Japan moved to Kamakura during the mid ninth century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The complex features many structures, all to appeal to the aesthetics of the garden designs. Over its history villas next to Todai-ji have become part of the complex, some of these are open to public viewing.

Attalus I, successor and nephew of Eumenes I, was the first to achieve full independence for the territory and proclaimed himself king after his victory over the Celtic Galatians in 228 BC. His son, Eumenes II, further limited the influence of the Galatians and ruled jointly with his brother Attalos II, who succeeded him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The altar structure is 35.64 meters wide and 33.4 meters deep; the front stairway alone is almost 20 meters wide.

			<Text>Sometimes referred to as the 'Tiger's Nest', Paro Taktsang is a prominent Himalayan Buddhist temple complex resting along the cliff face of the upper Paro Valley in Bhutan. The temple was built in 1692 by Gyalse Tenzin Rebgye, the fourth Druk Desi - secular ruler - of Bhutan. Tenzin Rebgye arrived at the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave - the site where Guru Padmasambhava, an 8th century Buddhist Guru credited for introducing Buddhism to Bhutan, was said to have meditated there from three years, three months, three weeks, three days and three hours.Paro Taktsang is best known for its thirteen taktsang - tiger lair - caves, where Padmasambhava is said to have meditated. Within the complex there is the Gu-ru mTshan-brgyad Lhakhang - "the Temple of the Guru with Eight Names", a temple devoted to the Guru himself. This temple is a cultural icon in Bhutan as well as a symbol of Buddhism in the country. At around March or April the popular Tsechu festival is held in the Paro Valley honouring Padmasambhava.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Legends surrounding the site are plentyful. The most commonly accepted belief is that Padmasambhava flew from Tibet to the Paro Valley on the back of a flying tigress and the site was consecrated to tame the Tiger demon. Another common legend is that a former wife of an emperor, Yeshe Tsogyal, became a disciple of Padmasambhava in Tibet, where she turned herself into a tigress and thus carried the Guru to the valley. From the eleventh century many Tibetan saints came to the site for meditation, some include Milarepa, Machig Labdrön and Thangton Gyelpo. Many of these saints, including all mentioned, established Buddhist monasteries, spreading Buddhism to all parts of the would-be country. On April 19, 1998, a fire broke out in the main building of the complex, containing within valuable paintings and religious artifacts. It is believed the fire was electrical in nature, either a short-circuit or a flickering lamp lighting tapestries. The cost of the fire is estimated at 135 million ngultrum - $US2.5 million today - and sadly the life of a monk. During 2005 both the King and the Government of Bhutan oversaw the restoration of the temple complex and its contents therein.</Text>

Built in 200 BC at the request of Han Gaozu, under the supervision of his prime minister Xiao He, it served as the administrative centre and imperial residence of the Western Han Dynasty, as well as the Western Jin dynasty and several other regimes during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The palace survived until the Tang dynasty when it was burnt down by marauding invaders en route to Tang Chang'an. This was the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 km² (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City, or 11 times the size of the Vatican City. It was one of the two majestic palaces built around the same time, the other being Changle Palace which was unfortunately burned down during the upsuper reign of Wang Mang. </Text>

			<Text>Te Tii Marae is a unique meeting center. Like other marae in the Pacific, it served as both a sacred place for religion and a social meeting place in Polynesian culture. The term 'marae' - mala'e in Tongan and malae in Samoan and Hawaiian - means 'cleared, free of weeds and trees'. In the Maori society the marae is where the culture flourishes; obligations between tribes are met there, families would hold certain occasions there, and important ceremonies are held there.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Te Tii Marae is more than that, however. The site is still in use today as part of Waitangi Day, the New Zealand holiday to commemorate the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. On February 6 1840 the treaty was signed in a marquee at the grounds of James Busby's house - now known as the Treaty House, making New Zealand part of the British Empire and ensuring the right of the Maori to their land and their rights as British subjects. However this had led to disagreements between the Europeans and Maori. The Maori view the treaty as a sacred pact, while the Pakeha - Maori for European New Zealanders - have taken disregard to it for many years. Chief Justice James Prendergast declared the treaty a 'legal nullity' in 1877, displaying the European disconcern of the treaty until the Treaty of Waitangi Act in 1975 - almost a century later.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today Te Tii Marae hosts the annual celebrations the day before Waitangi Day - Feburary 5 - where the New Zealander Prime Minister and other political figures are invited to the site and hears the speeches of the iwi - the large social group of Maori society. With celebration comes tensions between the two peoples as Waidangi Day is also a hotspot for Maori rights; as far back as 1971 Waitangi and the day have been marred by protests and activism concerning the treaty.</Text>

			<Text>Knossos Palace, also known as Labyrinth, is the largest Bronze Age archaeological site on Crete and probably the ceremonial and political centre of the Minoan civilization and culture. The palace appears as a maze of workrooms, living spaces, and store rooms close to a central square. Detailed images of Cretan life in the late Bronze Age are provided by images on the walls of this palace.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Palace is about 130 meters on a side and since the Roman period has been suggested as the source of the myth of the Labyrinth, an elaborate mazelike structure built for King Minos of Crete and designed by the legendary artificer Daedalus to hold the Minotaur, a creature that was half man and half bull and was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Knossos Palace was built gradually between 1700 and 1400 BC, with periodic rebuildings after destruction. The 6 acres (24,000 mq) of the palace included a theatre, a main entrance on each of its four cardinal faces and extensive storerooms, called magazines. They contained large clay vases that held oil, grains, dried fish, beans, and olives. Many of the items were created at the palace itself, which had grain mills, oil presses, and wine presses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Palace had at least three separate liquid management systems, one for supply, one for drainage of runoff, and one for drainage of waste water. Aqueducts brought fresh water to Kephala hill from springs at Archanes, about 10 km away. Water was distributed at the palace by gravity feed through terracotta pipes to fountains and spigots. Due to its placement on the hill, the palace received sea breezes during the summer. It had porticoes and air shafts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Palace also includes the Minoan Column, a structure notably different from other Greek columns. Unlike the stone columns characteristic of other Greek architecture, the Minoan column was constructed from the trunk of a cypress tree, common to the Mediterranean. The columns at the Palace of Minos were painted red and mounted on stone bases with round, pillow-like capitals.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The centerpiece of the "Minoan" Palace was the so-called Throne Room. This chamber has an alabaster seat built into the north wall. On three sides of the room are gypsum benches. The throne is flanked by the Griffin Fresco, with two griffins couchant facing the throne, one on either side. The actual use of the room and the throne is unclear. It is also speculated that the throne was made specifically for a female individual, since the indent seems to be shaped for a woman's buttocks.</Text>

As part of both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1, it connects the city of San Francisco on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula to Marin County. The Golden Gate Bridge was the longest suspension bridge span in the world when it was completed in 1937, and has become one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and of the United States. Despite its span length being surpassed by eight other bridges since its completion, it still has the second longest suspension bridge main span in the United States, after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. It has been declared one of the modern Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Joseph Baermann Strauss, a German-American structural engineer and designer, was the chief engineer in charge of overall design and construction of the bridge project. However, because he had little understanding or experience with cable-suspension designs, responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts. The final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by New York’s Manhattan Bridge designer Leon Moisseiff. Irving Morrow, a relatively unknown residential architect, designed the overall shape of the bridge towers, the lighting scheme, and Art Deco elements such as the streetlights, railing, and walkways.</Text>

The structure stands beside Lake Titicaca, near the Bolivian city of La Paz. Ten feet tall and thirteen feet wide, the gate is a single stone block weighing an estimated ten tons. Rediscovered by Europeans in the mid-nineteenth century, the gate was found lying on the ground with a large crack across its face. Even though the gate now sits on the site of its discovery, it is not believed to be the site of its construction, which remains uncertain. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gate is a wealth of knowledge of pre-Colombian art and architecture. The gate displays elements of Tiwanaku iconography known to be found throughout Peru and parts of Bolivia. Although there are differing theories of the inscriptions found, they are generally believed to possess astronomical, or perhaps astrological, significance and may have served a calendrical purpose.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Across the head of the gate are 48 squares surrounding a central figure. Each of these squares depict a winged effigy, 32 of which with human faces. All of these effigies look to the central figure, who also remains unknown. The figure is that of a man whose head is surrounded by rays which may represent the rays of the sun. The figure holds two stylized staffs which appear to represent thunder and lightning. Current theories about this character are that he may be the "Sun God", while other identify him as Viracocha, the Incan creator god - who is worshiped as a god of the sun and storms.</Text>

			<Text>Pena National Palace is a large romanticist palace located on a hill in the municipality of Sintra, Portugal. The hill was formerly the site of a monastery, which was constructed following a rumoured appiration of the Virgin Mary. This monastery was destroyed in the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755. Remaining untouched for many years, it was in 1838 that, after being purchased by King consort Ferdinand II, the grounds of the original monastery were rebuilt into a palace for the Portuguese royal family to stay at during the summer.  The building of this new palace was placed under command of a notable German architect and engineer, Baron Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege, and construction was completed in 1854.  It remained in possession of the Portuguese royal family until the Republican Revolution of 1910, after which it was turned into a national monument as well as a museum.  Finally, in 1995 the palace was turned into a world heritage site by UNESCO.</Text>

It served as the capital of the Saudeleur dynasty of the island from approximately the 12th century CE until 1628, when the site was abandoned. It is often refered to as the 'Venice of the Pacific', after the fact that the city was built on the shoreline and out to sea and features a series of canals throughout the site. Local legends say that Nan Madol was constructed by Olisihpa and Olosohpa, twin sorcerers who wished to worship the god of Agriculture, Nahnisohn Sahpw, and constructed an altar at the future site of the city. This lead to the sacred nature of most of the city, and the reason for the location of its construction. Food and Water were brought in by boat for the Saudeleur populace, which allowed for the continuation of the city. When this was interrupted by the invading Nahnmwarkis, who subsequently occupied the city following 1628, they were unable to sustain the city and eventually abandoned it.</Text>

			<Text>The Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian law code, dating back to about 1772 BC. It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code, and partial copies exist on a human-sized stone stele and various clay tablets. The Code consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" (lex talionis) as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free man.The Code of Hammurabi was one of several sets of laws in the ancient Near East.[7] The code of laws was arranged in orderly groups, so that everyone who read the laws would know what was required of them.[8] Earlier collections of laws include the Code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (ca. 2050 BC), the Laws of Eshnunna (ca. 1930 BC) and the codex of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (ca. 1870 BC), while later ones include the Hittite laws, the Assyrian laws, and Mosaic Law. These codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other. The Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period.[11] The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law regulating a government — i.e., a primitive constitution.</Text>

			<Text>Overlooking the waters of the Bosphorous, Topkapi Palace is a large palace complex located on the European side of Istanbul, Turkey. It was constructed under the orders of Mehmed II "The Conqueror", under whom the city was captured from the Byzantines and renamed Istanbul, as part of a scheme to re-build the city following the sucessful Ottoman siege. The palace served as the official residence of the Ottoman sultans for nearly four centuries of their rule, lasting until Sultan Abdul Mecid I moved the court to a newly-built palace further up the Bosphorous in 1856. Topkapi Palace is in fact more of a walled village than a palace, with several small buildings and many courtyards as opposed to one central structure. The site is home to many relics and artefacts collected both by the Sultans and following the end of the Ottoman empire when the palace was turned into a Museum. Among these are relics sacred to the Islamic world, including a door to the Great Mosque of Mecca, as well as what is said to be the cloak and sword of the prophet Muhammed. Other items include many collected from Silk Road trade, such as various pieces of Chinese porcelain from across four different dynasties of rule, and a collection of Islamic weaponry spanning approximately 13 centuries. Although the palace is largely still intact, some parts have since been lost as a result of either Earthquakes or fire.</Text>

Each held the title briefly, but the Empire State Building is the tallest, holding the title since 1930, when it was completed. It was surpassed by the construction of the World Trade Center towers, but is now the tallest again following the events of September 11, 2001. Upon construction of the 443 metre tall building, the top was originally hoped to be an Airship terminal for New York City, transporting passengers to the ground via two elevators. This, however, was deemed to risky due to updrafts caused by the size of the building. Along with the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building is a prime example of Art Deco architecture which was prominent during the Depression years of 1929-1932, and continued into World War 2.

			<Text>Buda Castle is a complex of fortifications and the residence to the Hungarian kings in Budapest. Castle Hill - site of Buda Castle - was first occupied in 1265 by King Béla IV. The oldest part of the complex is the foundations of Stephen's Tower, a caster keep built during the fourteenth century by Stephen, the Duke of Slovakia and younger brother to King Louis I of Hungary. King Sigismund strengthened its fortifications and enlarged the palace, from 1410 until after his death in 1437, as a bid to express primacy among Europe as the Holy Roman Emperor. Kings Matthias Corvinus, Vladislaus II and John Zápolya all continued the work of the expansion of the castle before the Ottomans conquered Budapest and the castle, and the subsequent sieges contributed to the medieval castle's ruin, especially during the Battle of Buda in 1686. Work on the castle was on and off for many years until in 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich appealed to the public to complete the repairs of the castle. The Palatine János Pálffy appealed to the countries and city-states to award grants; the moment was most opportune as support for the Habsburgs were at its peak and Hungarians supported Maria Theresa in the War of Austrian Succession. The queen was appreciative and funded the work to reconstruct Buda Castle. Since then the castle has gone through many cycles of destruction and rebuilding right up to the end of World War II, where in 1948 the re-construction of the castle took on a modernist design. The current version of the castle was build in 1966 and the interior completed in the 1980s.</Text>

		<Text>The Berlin Wall (German: Berliner Mauer) was a barrier constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) starting on 13 August 1961, that completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin.The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, "fakir beds" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that marked Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period. The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart" (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall) by GDR authorities, implying that neighbouring West Germany had not been fully de-Nazified. The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the "Wall of Shame"—a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt—while condemning the Wall's restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB) that demarcated the border between East and West Germany, both borders came to symbolize the "Iron Curtain" that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin, from where they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with an estimated death toll of over 600. In 1989, a series of radical political changes occurred in the Eastern Bloc, associated with the liberalization of the Eastern Bloc's authoritarian systems and the erosion of political power in the pro-Soviet governments in nearby Poland and Hungary. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, a euphoric public and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of the rest. The physical Wall itself was primarily destroyed in 1990. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.</Text>

			<Text>Carnival is a festive season which occurs immediately before Lent; the main events are usually during February. Carnival typically involves a public celebration or parade combining some elements of a circus, mask and public street party. People often dress up or masquerade during the celebrations, which mark an overturning of daily life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Carnival is a festival traditionally held in Roman Catholic and, to a lesser extent, Eastern Orthodox societies. Protestant areas usually do not have carnival celebrations or have modified traditions, such as the Danish Carnival or other Shrove Tuesday events. The Brazilian Carnaval is one of the best-known celebrations today, but many cities and regions worldwide celebrate with large, popular, and days-long events. The Carnival of Rio de Janeiro is the biggest carnival in the world, and the biggest popular party on the planet, according The Guinness Book of World Records 2010. The Rio de Janeiro Carnival is also considered the world's most famous.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While it forms an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, some carnival traditions may date back to pre-Christian times. The ancient Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Bacchanalia may possibly have been absorbed into the Italian Carnival. The Saturnalia, in turn, may be based on the Greek Dionysia and Oriental festivals. While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Many local carnival customs are based on local pre-Christian rituals, for example the elaborate rites involving masked figures in the Swabian-Alemannic carnival.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some of the best-known traditions, including carnival parades and "masquerade ball" masquerading, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was for a long time the most famous carnival. From Italy, carnival traditions spread to the Catholic nations of Spain, Portugal, and France. From France, they spread to the Rhineland of Germany, and to New France in North America. From Spain and Portugal, they spread with Catholic colonization to the Caribbean and Latin America.</Text>

The terraces are about 2000 years old, built by the ancient indigenous Ifugao, and is still fed today by an ancient irrigation system using the rainforests above. It is common belief that the ancient terraces were built with minimal equipment and mostly by hand. It is said that putting the steps to travel the terraces end to end, they would encircle half the Equator of our Earth. The Ifugao culture is dominated by the use of rice, introducing the many rice culture feasts to the young and agricultural rites from the cultivation to consumption of rice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today the terraces are still in use, farming rice and vegetables to the Ifugao. However, more of the Ifugao find farming unappealing to other industries. This has resulted in a slow erosion of the site - the steps having been most affected - and the greater need for care of the site. In 2010 a greater problem emerged - drought - which caused the terraces to dry up entirely by March.</Text>

Built on a hill by Raja Man Singh I, Amer Fort is a popular attraction for its artistic style and blending of Hindu and Rajput architecture. The fort overlooks the Maota Lake on a forested hill. During medieval India Amer was known as Dhundar and ruled by the Kachwahas, the fort itself was built in 1592 over the remnants of the earlier structure by Raja Man Singh I, a commander of Akbar the Great's army and a member of the Emperor's inner circle. His decendant, Jai Singh I expanded Amer Fort further. Beyond then Amer Fort continued the further improve with every ruler who followed for the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted the capital to Jaipur during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh II in 1727.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many of the original buildings of the medieval period have either been destroyed of replaced, the sixteenth century edifice however and the palace complex within build by the Rajput Maharajas is very well preserved. Amer Fort is split into four sections, each with its own gate and courtyard. The main entrance is the "Suraj Pole" - the Sun Gate - leading to the first courtyard. Armies held victory parades at the gate with their bounty. The gate was built for the purpose of protection, a garrison was posted to secure the main entry into the palace, and the gate itself faces east to greet the sun - where it takes its namesake. The first courtyard leads to the palace grounds and is resplendant with temples as well as the Ganesh Gate entering into the palaces. The second courtyard houses the Public Audience Hall; the Raja held audiences to heed petitions from the public. The Ganesh Gate opened into the third courtyard where the private quarters of the royal family and the servants were kept. This courtyard holds two buildings seperated but a garden fashioned similiarly to the Mughal Gardens. The two buildings are the "Jai Mandir", commonly known as the Sheesh Mahal - or Mirror Palace - and the "Sukh Niwas" or Sukh Mahal - the Hall of Pleasure. The Mirror Palace is known for its beautiful glass panels and mirror patterned ceilings. The fourth courtyard is where the royal family women resided, displaying a number of living rooms along a common corridor.</Text>

The temple was built by King Vidyadhara, arguably one of the greatest of the Chandela kings, at about 1050.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The main spire - the shikhara - rises 31 meters and forms the shape of Mount Kailash, the residence of lord Shiva; of whom the temple worships, and is surrounded by 84 smaller spires. The temple features columned halls, an entrance porch and the inner sanctum. 646 statues decorate the sides of the temple and at the top of the shikhara is the amalaka; a circular ring motif commonly found in the architecture of temples in northern India. Also, 226 figures are found lining parts of the temple's wall, but some of these are of a sexual nature and are not publicly displayed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The name of the site means 'the Cave of Mahadeva', Mahadeva being another name for Shiva.

			<Text>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur. Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the architect Lal Chand Ustad designed the structure from the crown of the Hindu god Krishna. The design of the 953 windows, known as 'jharokhas', is also compared to that of the honeycomb of the beehive. The original idea for the latticework on the windows is to allow the royal ladies to view the streets below without themselves being seen, observing strict 'purdah', face coverage. Sawai Pratap Singh's grandfather, Sawai Jai Singh founded Jaipur in 1727. Sawai Pratap Singh comissioned the Hawa Mahal as an expansion of the Royal City Palace, and Pratap Singh was a devoted adherent to Khrishna, this contributed to the design of the building as the Mukuta, Khrishna's headgear.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Though no actual historical evidence is available, it is believed that the women of the royal family, having to observe purdah, were given the opportunity to witness the transactions of the markets and royal processions behind the stone carved screens. Hawa Mahal was also used by the royal family as a retreat from the hot weather of Jaipur, the unusually designed windows provided a cool breeze and ventilation. The five story Hawa Mahal rises 50 feet from the base with the top three floors having the dimention of just one room, the bottom two floors have patios at the back of the structure. The shape of the front facade of the building is designed from semi-octagonal bays, producing its unique face, whereas the back side of the building retains need-based chambers with pillars and corridors reaching to the top floor. Inside the Hawa Mahal is described as "having rooms of different coloured marbles, relieved by inlaid panels; while fountains adorn the center of the courtyard".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lal Chand Ustad also planned the founding of Jaipur, considered at the time as one of the best-planned cities in India. The red and pink sandstone of the Hawa Mahal reflects the other monuments and the epithet of Jaipur as the "Pink City". It is also a reflection of the fusion of Rajput and Mughal architecture; the use of the Rajput style using domed canopies and fluted pillars, and the Mughal style of stone inlay filigrees and arches.</Text>

Built by Guru Arjan Dev in 1604, the Guru completed the Adi Granth, the holy text of Sikhism, and placed it in the Gurdwara. Before the building of the Harmandir Sahib, the site was surronded by a lake and thin forest. Akbar the Great visited Guru Amar Das at the neighbouring town of Goindval and was so impressed at the way of life in the town he gave the land and the revenues of the nearby villages to the Guru's daugther as a marital gift. At the end of 1588 Arjan Dev began the construction of the temple by laying the foundation stone, the construction took just over fifteen years to complete. In the mid eighteenth century the Harmandir Sahib was attacked by Afghans; one of Ahmed Shah Addali's generals, Jahan Khan, and required substancial reconstruction in 1764.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The four doors of the Harmandir Sahib symbolize the openness of Sikhism towards all people and their religions. Inside the temple are many shrines of past Gurus and saints, as well as commemorative plaques and inscriptions on the Gurus, saints and fallen Sikh soldiers during World Wars I and II. Outside there are three bers, holy trees, signifying historical events or Sikh saints. Much of the gilding and marble dates back to the early ninteenth century, the gold and marble were placed under the patronage of Hukam Singh Chimni and Emperor Ranjit Singh, the Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, the gold plating itself completing at 1830.</Text>

Just two and a half kilometers from the elegant Taj Mahal, the fort is first mentioned in 1080, where a Ghaznavide force took control of it. Sikandar Lodi was the first Sultan to stay in the fort as he shifted the capital of the Lodi Dynasty to Agra; in 1503 Sikandar commissioned the construction of much of modern-day Agra. The Mughals captured Agra and the fort in 1526, plundering the treasure inside - including the famous Koh-i-Noor Diamond. The Hindu king Hem Chandra Vikramaditya briefly captured Agra in 1553, but lost control three years after back to the Mughals under Akbar the Great. Under Akbar the fort underwent reconstruction in 1565, taking eight years to complete. Akbar's grandson, the famous Shah Jahan, would complete the fort during his reign to the current design.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Agra Fort is a 94 acre walled city in a semicircular design. Within the 70 foot high walls contains halls, mosques, houses from guesses, a ladies bazaar, and the Grape Garden - a large garden featuring its 85 square geometeric design. Along the wall two of the fort's gates are most noteworthy; the "Delhi Gate" and the "Lahore Gate", commonly known as the Amar Singh Gate, named after the nobleman. The Delhi Gate is the greatest of the four gates and was the masterpiece of Akbar the Great, built in 1568. Designed to enhance both the security and the embellishemtn of the formal gate, it is furnished in while marble as the prevailing symbol of the power of the Mughals. The general design of the gates and walls were to ensure the fort impregnable; during siege elephants would crush the gates of a fort, the Agra Fort - having been built on a uneven slope - rendered this method ineffective.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The fort is very important in understanding the architectural history. Akbar's historian, Abul Fazal, recorded 500 buildings in Bengal and Gujarat design were built. Some of these were destroyed by Shah Jahan to make room for his own palaces, others from the British between 1803 and 1862. Today just 30 Mughal buildings stand in the south-eastern side of the fort, of these the Delhi and Akbar Gates and the Bengali Mahal palace remain as symbols of Akbar the Great.</Text>

			<Text>The Roman Forum is a rectangular forum (plaza) surrounded by the ruins of several important ancient government buildings at the center of the city of Rome. Citizens of the ancient city referred to this space, originally a marketplace, as the Forum Magnum, or simply the Forum. It was for centuries the center of Roman public life: the site of triumphal processions and elections; the venue for public speeches, criminal trials, and gladiatorial matches; and the nucleus of commercial affairs. Here statues and monuments commemorated the city's great men. The teeming heart of ancient Rome, it has been called the most celebrated meeting place in the world, and in all history. Located in the small valley between the Palatine and Capitoline Hills, the Forum today is a sprawling ruin of architectural fragments and intermittent archeological excavations attracting numerous sightseers.</Text>

The name was inspired by the preternatural landscape of bizarre forms created by calcite deposits from the hot springs that surface through a fault: mineral forests, petrified cascades and terraced pools of an immense natural nymphaeum. The ancients attributing healing powers to the hot springs (35 °C) equal to their power to metamorphose the landscape, they founded a thermal station on the site in the late 2nd century. The history of Hierapolis followed the same course as many Hellenistic cities in Asia Minor. The Romans acquired full control of it in 129 BC and it prospered under its new rulers. It was a cosmopolitan city where Anatolians, Graeco-Macedonians, Romans and Jews intermingled. The hot springs which attracted throngs of people 'taking the waters' also served another purpose: scouring and dying wool.</Text>

The mosque is under the control of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. It is the second mosque built in history. One of the most notable features of the site is the Green Dome over the center of the mosque, where the tomb of Muhammad is located. It is not exactly known when the green dome was constructed but manuscripts dating to the early 12th century describe the dome. It is known as the Dome of the Prophet or the Green Dome. Subsequent Islamic rulers greatly expanded and decorated it. Early Muslim leaders Abu Bakr and Umar are buried in an adjacent area in the mosque.The site was originally Muhammad's house; he settled there after his Hijra to Medina, later building a mosque on the grounds. He himself shared in the heavy work of construction. The original mosque was an open-air building. The basic plan of the building has been adopted in the building of other mosques throughout the world.</Text>

The genus's native range extends west to the Iberian Peninsula, through North Africa to Greece, the Balkans, Turkey, throughout the Levant (Syria, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan) and Iran, North to Ukraine, southern Siberia and Mongolia, and east to the Northwest of China. The tulip's centre of diversity is in the Pamir, Hindu Kush, and Tien Shan mountains.[3] It is a typical element of steppe and winter-rain Mediterranean vegetation. A number of species and many hybrid cultivars are grown in gardens, as potted plants, or to be displayed as fresh-cut flowers. Tulip cultivars have usually several species in their direct background, but most have been derived from Tulipa suaveolens, often erroneously listed as Tulipa schrenkii. Tulipa gesneriana is in itself an early hybrid of complex origin and is not the same taxon as was described by Conrad Gesner in the 16th century.</Text>

Originally the site of a military base in the 18th and early 19th centuries, development of the area into a governmental precinct began in 1859, after Queen Victoria chose Bytown as the capital of the Province of Canada. Following a number of extensions to the parliament and departmental buildings and a fire in 1916 that destroyed the Centre Block, Parliament Hill took on its present form with the completion of the Peace Tower in 1927.

In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271. It became known as Crac de l'Ospital; the name Krak des Chevaliers was coined in the 19th century.</Text>

			<Text>In the second half of nineteenth century, theatrical activity was very intense in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of the country. Still, its two theaters, the Lyric and St. Peter, were criticized for their facilities, either by the public or by the companies that worked in them. After the Proclamation of the Republic (1889), in 1894 playwright Arthur Azevedo launched a campaign for the building of a new theater to host a local company, to be created along the lines of the Comédie Française. However, in those hectic days, the campaign resulted in only one Municipal Law, which ordered the construction of the Municipal Theater. This law was not enforced, despite the existence of a levy to finance the work. Thus, that the new tax revenue was never used for the construction of the theater. The Theatro Municipal (Municipal Theatre) of Rio de Janeiro is located in Cinelândia (Praça Marechal Floriano) in the city center of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Built in the beginning of the twentieth century, it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and important theatres in the country.</Text>

Set amongst rice, tea and tobacco fields the Tulou are earthen houses. Several storeys high, they are built along an inward-looking, circular or square floor plan as housing for up to 800 people each. They were built for defence purposes around a central open courtyard with only one entrance and windows to the outside only above the first floor. Housing a whole clan, the houses functioned as village units and were known as “a little kingdom for the family” or “bustling small city.” They feature tall fortified mud walls capped by tiled roofs with wide over-hanging eaves. The most elaborate structures date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. The buildings were divided vertically between families with each disposing of two or three rooms on each floor. In contrast with their plain exterior, the inside of the tulou were built for comfort and were often highly decorated. They are inscribed as exceptional examples of a building tradition and function exemplifying a particular type of communal living and defensive organization, and, in terms of their harmonious relationship with their environment, an outstanding example of human settlement.</Text>

Then came the Sulpician Fathers, who in 1657 undertook construction of a larger church. The Sulpician François Dollier de Casson was its architect, and the present-day Notre-Dame Street served as the original site. Its construction, in Baroque style was completed between 1672 and 1683.[NEWLINE]By 1800, Dollier’s church had become too small, and the Fabrique decided to build the church we know today. To design the new church, the building council engaged the services of the New York architect James O’Donnell – himself an Irish Protestant by origin. O’Donnell and the Fabrique opted for the Gothic Revival style then in vogue in England and the United States. The main construction work took place between 1824 and 1829.</Text>

Located in Saudi Arabia, it is also the largest of the Nabataean cities outside of Petra, and also features the stone-cut buildings. The main feature of the site is approximately 130 tombs cut from the rock face surrounding the area. Some of these tombs have had most of the cliffs around them weathered away, and so remain as a monumental solitary rock featuring a beautifully preserved tomb. The site was originally settled by Lihyanite people around 7 centuries prior to the Nabataens, although sources within the Qu'ran, the Islamic holy book, tell of an older civilization that inhabited the area 3000 years before this. In the year 106, the area was conquered by Roman armies, whom annexed it into the Roman provence of Arabia. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] For years the site of Mada'in Saleh has had little disturbance by travellers. This is due to a passage in the Qu'ran in which the non-believers that were in the site were killed by lightning and an earthquake. This resulted in Islamic merchants spreading word of a curse at the site, which for centuries scared travellers enough to stay away from the site. As a result, the area remains in a near pristine condition to this day.</Text>

			<Text>El Tajín is one of the largest and most important pre-Colombian cities in Classical Mesoamerica. From as far back as at least 5600 BC, nomadic hunters and gatherers became farmers to create the complex societies of a civilization. While the city's rise in both prominence and progression hastened during the rise of the Olmec, c. 1150 BC, it is still not entirely clear who did build the city, though mounting evidence suggests the Huastec culture.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Monumental construction began at about the first century CE, and from this by 600 El Tajín was a city. The city's position over the Mesoamerican trade routes is largely due to its rise; the city was able to control the flow of the import and export of commodites. One of its major trade partners of its time was Teotihuacan.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The most noted feature of the site is the Pyramid of Niches. This structure has seven stories, each of which consist of a sloping base and a vertical wall. These features are common in Mesoamerican architecture, but the pyramid also contains uncommon designs, mainly decorative niches. The original design of this pyramid was ritual; the niches imitate caves, these were considered to be underground passages to the underworld, where a number of the gods lived.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Tajín lasted up to the thirteenth century when it caught on fire, it is assumed that the invading Chichimecas at the time are to blame. The jungle took over the site and it rested dormant for more than half a millenium, until 1785; a chance discovery by Diego Ruiz stumbled upon the Pyramid of Niches. At the time Ruiz was searching for clandestine tobacco plantations that breached the royal monopoly.</Text>

It was first observed during the 1960's, when archeologists noted that the hill could not be natural due to the shape, yet dismissed it as a Byzantine burial ground. It was not thought different until 1994, and not excavated until a year later. The complex is similar in manner to Stonehenge, with a round shape and large Monolithic stones.

			<Text>The Tower of Babel, according to the Book of Genesis, was an enormous tower built in the plain of Shinar. A united humanity of the generations following the Great Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, came to the land of Shinar, where they resolved to build a city with a tower "with its top in the heavens". According to the biblical account, God came down to see what they did and said: "They are one people and have one language, and nothing will be withholden from them which they purpose to do." So God said, "Come, let us go down and confound their speech." And so God scattered them upon the face of the Earth, and confused their languages, and they left off building the city, which was called Babel "because God there confounded the language of all the Earth". [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Tower of Babel has often been associated with known structures, notably the Etemenanki, a ziggurat dedicated to Marduk by Nabopolassar (c. 610 BC). According to modern scholars, the biblical story of the Tower of Babel was likely influenced by Etemenanki during the Babylonian captivity of the Hebrews. The Greek historian Herodotus (440 BC) later wrote of this ziggurat, which he called the "Temple of Zeus Belus", giving an account of its vast dimensions. The already decayed Great Ziggurat of Babylon was finally destroyed by Alexander the Great in an attempt to rebuild it. He managed to move the tiles of the tower to another location, but his death stopped the reconstruction.</Text>

It features a vertical ascent of approximately 2,100 metres along the 78 kilometre track, and was built during the British Raj period of the colonialism of the country in order to provide railroad access to the area, which was perfect for Tea plantations. It is often referred to as the 'Toy train' due to the small size of the train and tracks, a design which was deliberate to allow the train to handle the steep ascent to Darjeeling. The railway was closed for a brief period in the late 1980's during a violent Gorkhaland movement, in which residents of the area campaigned for a seperate state within India to recognise their ethnic heritage of Gorkhas. </Text>

It consists of the dish, which is on the ground, and a large reciever suspended above the dish by three towers which vary in height due to ground elevation. Since its construction in 1963, the observatory has been used for a variety of different purposes. Originally designed to study Earth's Ionosphere (The layer of Earth's atmosphere above 85 kilometres where solar radiation still affects the atmosphere. Auroras form in this layer), the Arecibo Observatory has since made a variety of discoveries and been used for several research projects. In 1990, the telescope was used to discover the first ever known Exo-planets (Planets existing outside our own Solar System). It was also used to discover Neutron stars (stars that half half a million times more mass than Earth in an area equivalent to the size of Brooklyn, New York). It has also been used for countless other astronomical discoveries. In 1974, the Observatory sent a message of binary characters, consisting of the numbers 1 to 10, DNA makeup, the solar system and more information, towards a star cluster known as globular cluser M13, around 25,000 light years away, in the hope of contacting intelligent life. </Text>

The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Nubian Monuments," which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan). The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside during the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II in the 13th century BC, as a lasting monument to himself and his queen Nefertari, to commemorate his alleged victory at the Battle of Kadesh, and to intimidate his Nubian neighbors. However, the complex was relocated in its entirety in 1968, on an artificial hill made from a domed structure, high above the Aswan High Dam reservoir. The relocation of the temples was necessary to avoid their being submerged during the creation of Lake Nasser, the massive artificial water reservoir formed after the building of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile River. Abu Simbel remains one of Egypt's top tourist attractions.</Text>

Built from 1904 to 1914, annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in the canal's early days to 14,702 vessels in 2008. In total over 815,000 vessels have passed through the canal. It has been named one of the seven modern wonders of the world by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The canal had an enormous impact on shipping between the two oceans, replacing the long and treacherous route via either the Strait of Magellan or Cape Horn at the southernmost tip of South America. A ship sailing from New York to San Francisco via the canal travels 9,500 km, well under half the 22,500 km route around Cape Horn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The concept of a canal near Panama dates to the early 16th century. The first attempt to construct a canal began in 1880 under French leadership, but was abandoned after 21,900 workers died, largely from disease, particularly malaria and yellow fever, and landslides. The United States launched a second effort, incurring a further 5,600 deaths but succeeding in opening the canal in 1914. The U.S. controlled the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for the transition of control to Panama. From 1979 to 1999 the canal was under joint U.S.–Panamanian administration, and from 31 December 1999 command of the waterway was assumed by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government.</Text>

			<Text>Templo Mayor was a large double temple done in the iconic Mesoamerican Stepped Pyramid style located in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, modern day Mexico City. It was dedicated to two gods of the Aztec pantheon, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, and Tlaloc, the god of rain and agriculture. The dedication to two gods was the reason for the temple having twin shrines and staircases, each one dedicated to a seperate god. It is widely believed that the Shrine of Tlaloc was painted blue, while Huitzilopochtli's shrine was red. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The exact date of the first construction is not known, although most estimates put this to be sometime in the early 14th century. Each sucessive generation of Aztec citizens increased the size of Templo Mayor by building around the previous building. This is believed to have happened about six times across the life of the temple. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs by Hernan Cortez in 1521, Templo Mayor was destroyed, along with the rest of Tenochtitlan. The Spanish filled in the lake upon which the city was built, and covered the site in soil. They then built the modern day city of Mexico on the site. </Text>

			<Text>The Totem is a stipulated ancestor of a group of people, such as a family, clan, lineage, or tribe. Totems support larger groups than the individual person. In kinship and descent, if the apical ancestor of a clan is nonhuman, it is called a totem. Normally this belief is accompanied by a totemic myth. Although the term is of Ojibwe origin in North America, totemistic beliefs are not limited to Native Americans. Similar totem-like beliefs have been historically present in societies throughout much of the world, including Africa, Asia, Australia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and the Arctic polar region.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Totemism is a religious belief that is frequently associated with shamanistic religions. The totem is usually an animal or other natural figure that spiritually represents a group of related people such as a clan. The mis-named totem poles of the Pacific Northwest of North America are, in fact, not totemic in nature, rather they are heraldic in nature. They feature many different designs (bears, birds, frogs, people, and various supernatural beings and aquatic creatures) that function as crests of families or chiefs. They recount stories owned by those families or chiefs, and/or commemorate special occasions.</Text>

The supposed burial site of the apostle Peter in 64 AD, some years later a shrine was constructed there. Replacing the shrine, construction of "old" St. Peter's was begun by the Emperor Constantine between 319 and 333 AD. Having fallen into serious disrepair over the centuries, Pope Julius II in 1505 determined to demolish the old church and replace it with a monumental structure, a construction project that spanned the next 120 years under a succession of popes and architects. To finance the colossal project, a number of popes authorized the wholesale selling of indulgences, a practice that led in part to Martin Luther's protestant movement. With work by some of the Renaissance's leading figures - Michelangelo, Raphael, Bramante, Bernini and others - the church now stands as one of the great treasures of Western civilization.</Text>

			<Text>National parks and national monuments in the United States were originally individually managed under the auspices of the Department of the Interior. The movement for an independent agency to oversee these federal lands was spearheaded by business magnate and conservationist Stephen Mather, as well as J. Horace McFarland. With the help of journalist Robert Sterling Yard, Mather ran a publiCity campaign for the Department of the Interior. They wrote numerous articles that praised the scenic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for educational, inspirational, and recreational benefits.  This campaign resulted in the creation of a National Park Service. On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed a bill that mandated the agency "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."  Mather became the first director of the newly formed NPS.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]On March 3, 1933, President Herbert C. Hoover signed the Reorganization Act of 1933. The act would allow the President to reorganize the executive branch of the United States government. It wasn't until later that summer when the new President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, made use of this power. Deputy Director Horace M. Albright had suggested to President Roosevelt that the historic sites from the American Civil War should be managed by the National Park Service, rather than the War Department. President Roosevelt agreed and issued two Executive orders to make it happen. These two executive orders not only transferred to the National Park Service all the War Department historic sites, but also the national monuments managed by the Department of Agriculture and the parks in and around the capital, which had been run by an independent office.</Text>

			<Text>In the microelectronics industry, a semiconductor fabrication plant (commonly called a fab) is a factory where devices such as integrated circuits are manufactured.  A business that operates a semiconductor fab for the purpose of fabricating the designs of other companies, such as fabless semiconductor companies, is known as a foundry. If a foundry does not also produce its own designs, it is known as a pure-play semiconductor foundry.  Fabs require many expensive devices to function. Estimates put the cost of building a new fab over one billion US dollars with values as high as $3-4 billion not being uncommon. TSMC will be investing 9.3 billion dollars in its Fab15 300 mm wafer manufacturing facility in Taiwan to be operational in 2012.</Text>

			<Text>The Human Genome Project (HGP) is an international scientific research project with a primary goal of determining the sequence of chemical base pairs which make up DNA and to identify and map the approximately 20,000–25,000 genes of the human genome from both a physical and functional standpoint.  The project began in 1990 and was initially headed by James D. Watson at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. A working draft of the genome was released in 2000 and a complete one in 2003, with further more detailed analysis still being published. A parallel project was conducted outside of government by the Celera Corporation. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in universities and research centers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, China, India, Canada, and New Zealand. The mapping of human genes is an important step in the development of medicines and other aspects of health care.</Text>

Geologically, hillside erosion exposed the northern end of the cavity, which extends horizontally for about 140 m into the base of a hill. Accumulted deposits inside the cave, up to 7 m in depth, reflect natural sedimentation processes such as water and wind deposition as well as the activities of animals, birds and human ancestors over a period of some 2 million years. The site has been studied and excavated by archaeologists since the 1940s and research here generates important insights into human history in the subcontinent of Southern Africa.

Its construction began in 447 BC and was completed in 438 BC, although decorations of the Parthenon continued until 431 BC. It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered to be the culmination of the development of the Doric order. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art.</Text>

The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythis.  It stood approximately 45 m (148 ft) in height, and each of the four sides was adorned with sculptural reliefs created by each one of four Greek sculptors — Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas of Paros and Timotheus.  The finished structure was considered to be such an aesthetic triumph that Antipater of Sidon identified it as one of his Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</Text>

Among his advances in physics are the foundations of hydrostatics, statics and an explanation of the principle of the lever. He is credited with designing innovative machines, including siege engines and the screw pump that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested claims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Archimedes is generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time.  He used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of pi.  He also defined the spiral bearing his name, formulae for the volumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers.</Text>

Copernicus' epochal book, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), published just before his death in 1543, is often regarded as the starting point of modern astronomy and the defining epiphany that began the scientific revolution. His heliocentric model, with the Sun at the center of the universe, demonstrated that the observed motions of celestial objects can be explained without putting Earth at rest in the center of the universe. His work stimulated further scientific investigations, becoming a landmark in the history of science that is often referred to as the Copernican Revolution.</Text>

			<Text>The Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible, the Mazarin Bible or the B42) was the first major book printed with a movable type printing press, marking the start of the "Gutenberg Revolution" and the age of the printed book. Widely hailed for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities, the book has iconic status in the West. It is an edition of the Vulgate, printed by Johannes Gutenberg, in Mainz, Germany in the 1450s. Only twenty-one complete copies survive, and they are considered by many sources to be the most valuable books in the world, even though a completed copy has not been sold since 1978.</Text>

			<Text>A constitution is a set of laws that a set of people have made and agreed upon for government—often as a written document—that enumerates and limits the powers and functions of a political entity. These rules together make up, i.e. constitute, what the entity is. In the case of countries and autonomous regions of federal countries the term refers specifically to a constitution defining the fundamental political principles, and establishing the structure, procedures, powers and duties, of a government. By limiting the government's own reach, most constitutions guarantee certain rights to the people. The term constitution can be applied to any overall system of law that defines the functioning of a government, including several uncodified historical constitutions that existed before the development of modern codified constitutions.</Text>

Newton also published two further editions, in 1713 and 1726.  The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics, also Newton's law of universal gravitation, and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which Kepler first obtained empirically). The Principia is "justly regarded as one of the most important works in the history of science".  The French mathematical physicist Alexis Clairaut assessed it in 1747: "The famous book of mathematical Principles of natural Philosophy marked the epoch of a great revolution in physics.</Text>

It also completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth, although Magellan himself did not complete the entire voyage, being killed during the Battle of Mactan in the Philippines.</Text>

Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.</Text>

It was a place where people gathered to hear royal proclamations and of public executions, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Samarkand is also known for being an Islamic centre for scholarly study. The Registan is framed by three madrasahs, built in the 15th to 17th centuries, of distinctive Islamic architecture. In the 15th century the great astronomer Ulugh Beg built one of the largest observatories of its time in Samarkand, though it was destroyed by religious fanatics soon afterwards.</Text>
