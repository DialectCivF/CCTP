<!-- 
	NOTE: Depends on ReligionFoundedEvent.

	Once a player founds a religion if it contains a founder belief listed in this table
	the player will have the buildingClass placed in their capital (not holy city).  It
	does not matter what religion any of the player's cities are.
	
	Only founder beliefs should be provided as belief type.  Other belief types will
	not work correctly.
	
	If a player's capital moves (due to being captured) the buildingClass will
	automatically be moved to the new capital.
